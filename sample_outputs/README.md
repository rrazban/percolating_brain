This directory contains a sample of output files generated from `process/dmri2adjacency_matrix.py`

* `atlas/` outputs use the Harvard-Oxford atlas and Desikan-Killiany atlas. Note that the Talairach atlas is the default atlas used in this work.
* `method/` outputs are from different methods in `dmri2adjacency_matrix.py` to process the diffusion MRI images. Constant Solid Angle (Q-Ball) with a spherical harmonic of 8 and diffusion tensor imaging are shown. Note that Constant Solid Angle with a spherical harmonic of 6 is the default method used in this work.
* `standard/` outputs use the default atlas and method.


`mice/` contains viral tracing data taken directly from the Allen Institute (Oh et al. 2014). We did not process this data.
